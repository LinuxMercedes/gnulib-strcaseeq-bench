This is some fairly trivial benchmark code for benchmarking the gnulib STRCASEEQ optimization.

I ran into it and, out of curiosity, wanted to measure it.

Compiling
=======


```sh
aclocal
autoheader
automake --add-missing # ignore errors
autoreconf
automake
./configure
make
```

Upper / lowercase comparison
========================

By default, it compares (ignoring case) utf-8 to UTF-8. To make them both uppercase to begin with, you can compile with `./configure CPPFLAGS='-DALREADY_UPPER'` and then `make clean && make`
